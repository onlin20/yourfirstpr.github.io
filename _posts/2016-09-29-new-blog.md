Your First Pull Request has a blog! _more info here_

One of the most important things you need to know about the blog is where to put posts. Place post files inside the `_posts` folder. Next is the file name, use the following format: `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`. An example would be this post, `2016-09-29-new-blog.md`. The title in the file name is used to create the url slug, _i.e._ `yourfirstpr.github.io/blog/new-blog.html` We can set a bigger, better title in the Front Matter.

Jekyll, which runs this site, uses [YAML Front Matter](http://www.yaml.org/start.html) to convey information to the site engine. To keep compatibility use the following format for posts:

layout: post
title: Your Bigger, Properly Cased, Post Title

author-url: optional url to your twitter or personal site etc

Jekyll uses [Kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html) flavoured markdown by default.
